# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison
The idea is to understand and implement machine learning models to a given problem statement of predictions for the customer churn at a wireless telecom [Hypothetical ] company with 7043 customers in the database, and 20 potential predictors.
The dataset is provided as [Churn.csv]. The dataset is used to train and validate the different machine learning models-
1) Logistic Regression
2) Neural Network
3) Random forrest Regression
4) SVR
5) Linear Regression-
